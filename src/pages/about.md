## About

This is an open source project, created by a group of developers who love MMA. It is not monetized.

Our purpose is to provide a free and fast API from this popular sport. There were lots of APIs for everything you can imagine, except MMA. That's the reason we created **Octagon API**.

Now, MMA fan developers can create their own projects with their favorite fighters information, bringing a breath of fresh air to the common API based projects.
