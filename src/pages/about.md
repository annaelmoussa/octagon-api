# About

**Octagon API** is an open source project, created by a passionate MMA fan and developer..

The purpose of this project is to provide a free, fast and reliable API for accessing comprehensive information about the popular sport of MMA.

While there are numerous APIs available for a variety of purposes, there were none dedicated to MMA enthusiasts. Recognizing this gap inspired the creation of **Octagon API**.

Now, MMA fan developers can easily add detailed and updated fighter information into their own project, bringing a breath of fresh air to the typical API based projects and applications.
